/*

Static Memory Allocation:
Memory allocated during compile time is called static memory.

Problems faced in static memory allocation:
The memory allocated is fixed and cannot be increased and decreased during run time.
If you are allocating memory for an array during compile time then you have to fix the size at the time of declaration.
Size is fixed and user cannot increase or decrease the size of the array at run time.
If the value stored by the user in the array at run time is less than the size specified then there will be wastage
of memory.
If the valued stored by the user in the array at run time is more than the size specified then the program may crash
or misbehave.
